# Channels and ASGI

1. Install channels and configure settings, routing.py

2. Set up a consumer: Consumers are individual pieces of code that can handle
WebSockets in a very similar way to traditional HTTP views. You will build
a consumer to read and write messages to a communication channel.

3. Configure routing: Channels provides routing classes that allow you to
combine and stack your consumers. You will configure URL routing for
your chat consumer.

4. Implement a WebSocket client: When the student accesses the chat room,
you will connect to the WebSocket from the browser and send or receive
messages using JavaScript.

5. Enable a channel layer: Channel layers allow you to talk between different
instances of an application. They're a useful part of making a distributed
real-time application. You will set up a channel layer using Redis.
